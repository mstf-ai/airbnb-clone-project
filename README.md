## üß© UI Component Patterns

To ensure a consistent, reusable, and scalable design, the Airbnb Clone will adopt a **component-based approach**. Below are the key UI components we plan to create:

### üîπ Core Components
1. **Navbar (Navigation Bar)**  
   - Provides quick access to main sections (Home, Listings, Checkout, Profile).  
   - Includes logo, search bar, and user account menu.  
   - Stays fixed at the top for easy navigation.  

2. **Property Card**  
   - Displays essential details about a property (image, title, price per night, rating).  
   - Allows users to preview properties at a glance.  
   - Responsive design to ensure consistency across devices.  

3. **Footer**  
   - Contains links to key information (About, Contact, Help, Terms & Privacy).  
   - May include social media icons and newsletter subscription.  
   - Maintains branding consistency at the bottom of all pages.  

---

### üéØ Importance of Component Patterns
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused across multiple pages, reducing redundancy.  
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniform design and behavior across the app.  
- **Scalability:** New features can be added easily by extending existing patterns.  
- **Maintainability:** Isolating UI elements makes debugging and updating simpler.
